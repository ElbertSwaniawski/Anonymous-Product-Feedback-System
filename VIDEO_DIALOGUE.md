# Anonymous Product Feedback System - Video Narration
## Dialogue Script (Without Timestamps)

---

## Introduction

Welcome to the Anonymous Product Feedback System - a privacy-preserving voting platform built on FHEVM that enables completely anonymous product ratings while maintaining verifiable on-chain statistics.

---

## Problem Statement

Traditional product rating systems expose individual votes, compromising user privacy and enabling manipulation. Our FHEVM solution encrypts every vote on-chain while still allowing transparent statistical analysis.

---

## Project Setup

Getting started is simple. Clone the repository, install dependencies, and compile the smart contracts using Hardhat. The project follows standard FHEVM development patterns for easy integration.

---

## Smart Contract Demonstration

The smart contract demonstrates FHEVM's core features: encrypted vote storage, duplicate prevention through access control, and homomorphic computation for aggregate statistics without revealing individual votes.

---

## Deployment and Testing

Deploy to any FHEVM-compatible network with a single command. Our comprehensive test suite validates encrypted voting, access control, and statistical accuracy.

---

## Live Application Demo

The live application demonstrates real-world usage. Users connect their wallet, submit encrypted votes, and view aggregated statistics - all while maintaining complete privacy.

---

## FHEVM Features Summary

This FHEVM example demonstrates encrypted state management, access control, and privacy-preserving analytics - essential building blocks for confidential smart contracts.

## Closing

Anonymous Product Feedback System. Built for Zama FHEVM Bounty - December 2025. Privacy-First. Transparent Results. Decentralized Trust.

## Additional Narration Points (Optional)

### When Showing Code:
"Notice how the submitVote function encrypts individual ratings before storing them on-chain, ensuring complete voter privacy."

"The getProductStats function performs homomorphic computation on encrypted data, returning aggregate statistics without ever decrypting individual votes."

### When Showing Tests:
"Each test validates critical FHEVM functionality: encrypted storage, access control enforcement, and accurate statistical computation."

### When Showing Frontend:
"The user interface provides a seamless Web3 experience, abstracting the complexity of encrypted operations while maintaining security."

### Technical Highlights:
"FHEVM enables computation on encrypted data, allowing us to calculate averages and totals without exposing individual ratings."

"Access control patterns ensure that each user can vote only once per product, preventing manipulation while preserving anonymity."

"The system demonstrates selective transparency - aggregate statistics are public while individual votes remain permanently private."

## Script Notes

This dialogue is designed for a 60-second video demonstration. The narration should be:

1. **Clear and Concise**: Every word counts in a one-minute video
2. **Technically Accurate**: Properly represent FHEVM concepts
3. **Engaging**: Maintain viewer interest throughout
4. **Educational**: Explain what the system does and why it matters
5. **Professional**: Suitable for a technical competition submission

The script can be adapted based on:
- Actual video pacing
- Visual content shown
- Demonstration flow
- Specific features highlighted

Remember to leave brief pauses between sections to allow visual elements to be absorbed.
